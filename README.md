## What's this about?
These are some detection rules for Azure Sentinel analytics, these help detect bad behaviour within a network. Folder titled 'lolbas' contains rules surrounding abuse of system binaries which is becoming increasingly common for threat actors to use throughout the attack, from initial access -> exfiltration, as they are much less detected, than say a generic malware.exe 

In the root folder you will find rules surrounding recent breaches/ exploits/ vulnerabilities.
