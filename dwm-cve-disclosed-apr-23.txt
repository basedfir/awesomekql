dwm.exe - cve-2021-28310 - dwmcore.dll 
----------------------------------------
Available mitigations of course include msft security patches from Apr 13 but we also know this isn't always available.
	Deny dwm.exe, dwmcore.dll internet connectivity C:\Windows\SysWOW64\dwmcore.dll , C:\Windows\System32\dwmcore.dll [policy deny, kill]

Pretty much any platform wherein dwm.exe can be restricted from connecting to the internet and invoking cmd/ powershell, which is most EDR products, and although dwm.exe isn't by default bound to a network stack, this could be changed by this exploit, since the kernel calls dwm.exe to handle at sys level. 
Since this attack vector is local Microsoft has only assigned a 7.2 cvss intitially, as r/w access is required to the target machine.

Overview:
Install MSFT sec update, apr 13
Restrict dwm.exe internet connectivity, command prompt/ ps/ winbash 

AZ Sentinel; preliminary as intel is not there yet 

Sysmon
