A query to quickly see the largest tables in your sentinel instance by volume (and therefore log source ingestion rates)
// search * = search (all log sources unless defined), * = wildcard for anything (so all logs) 
search * 
// when using search argument, $table column is present to distinguish between tables *(and therefore log sources)
| summarize count() by $table
// sort by the highest count of logs per $table <
| sort by count_ desc
